# subiml
BIML language definition for SublimeText. 

## Installation and Use

If you haven't already, [install Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation), then select `Biml` from the `Package Control: Install Package` dropdown list in the Command Palette.

To set this as your default Biml syntax, open a Biml file, then select `View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as... -> Biml`.

To turn on the Biml color scheme, select `Preferences -> Color Scheme -> Biml -> Biml`, which will show snippet (T4) block highlights and other highlighting.
